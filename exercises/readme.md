# Requirements

1. Do all the exercises.
2. There is no deadline for the exercises **but** in order to take the oral examination, you have to have completed all the exercises. Exercises marked as *optional* are optional.

# Suggestions

1. Do the exercises week by week.
2. Let me know if you want me to review your codes.
3. Push the implementations of the exercises on the master branch of your fork.
4. Read and review the codes of your mates. This is the best way to learn. As for natural languages you learn to write by reading books, essays etc. You learn to code by reading others' codes and practicing as well.
5. Try to do the *optional* exercises. I don't give hints for the solution to this type of exercises. Typically, you need more than what is explained during the lecture. So, Google is your friend. In this way you will learn what to look for and how to look for it. You are forced to read others' solutions and possibly understand them. Simple copy-and-paste doesn't help.
6. Ask questions.
7. Ask questions.
8. Ask questions.
9. You can always (re-)implement old exercises with the new features you will learn throughout the course.
10. It is normal to write the same piece of code **at least three times**:
    1. To understand how to code it
    2. To make it right
    3. To make it better
11. **Keep it simple**, as simple as you can!
12. Don't panic: you will do it!
